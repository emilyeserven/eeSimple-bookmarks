# eeSimple Bookmarks

Self-deploy app for saving and organizing bookmarks.

eeSimple Bookmarks is a full-stack TypeScript pnpm monorepo: a React client, a Fastify API, a shared types
package, and a production gateway that ties them together behind a single port. It mirrors the
tooling and architecture of [course-tracker](https://github.com/emilyeserven/course-tracker).

## Architecture

| Package | Scope | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/types` | `@eesimple/types` | Shared TypeScript types (the API ↔ client contract). |
| `packages/middleware` | `@eesimple/middleware` | Fastify 5 API with Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL, Swagger UI at `/docs`. |
| `packages/client` | `@eesimple/client` | React 19 + Vite + TanStack Router/Query/Form + Tailwind 4. |
| `packages/gateway` | `@eesimple/gateway` | Fastify reverse proxy and production entrypoint. |

**Build order:** types → middleware → client (the gateway has no build step).

**Tech stack:** Node 22, pnpm 10, TypeScript 5.9 (strict, ES2022). Quality gates via ESLint
(`@emilyeserven/eslint-config`), Husky + commitlint (Conventional Commits), and
[Fallow](https://github.com/fallow-rs/fallow) for dead-code / duplication / complexity audits.

## Local development

Prerequisites: Node 22, pnpm 10 (`corepack enable`), and Docker.

```bash
pnpm install                              # install all workspace dependencies
cp packages/middleware/.env.example packages/middleware/.env
pnpm dev                                  # starts Postgres, pushes the schema, runs all packages
```

`pnpm dev` brings up the database via Docker Compose, applies the schema (runtime migrations then a
reconciling `drizzle-kit push`), then runs the types watcher, the API (http://localhost:3001, docs
at `/docs`), and the client (http://localhost:5173) concurrently. The API auto-seeds a sample
bookmark on first run.

The schema is managed with **Drizzle migrations**. After changing `packages/middleware/src/db/schema.ts`,
generate a migration and commit the result:

```bash
pnpm --filter=@eesimple/middleware generate   # writes a new SQL file under packages/middleware/drizzle/
```

Migrations are applied automatically on `pnpm dev` and on every deploy; `drizzle-kit push` runs
afterward only to reconcile any residual drift.

### Useful commands

```bash
pnpm build            # build types → middleware → client
pnpm test             # run all package tests
pnpm typecheck        # strict type checking across packages
pnpm lint / lint:fix  # ESLint (run from the repo root)
pnpm verify:changed   # lint + typecheck + test only the changed packages
pnpm fallow           # dead-code / duplication / complexity audit
pnpm studio           # Drizzle Studio (database GUI)
pnpm push:dev         # run migrations + push the Drizzle schema to the local database
```

To reset the database: `docker compose down -v && docker compose up --wait db && pnpm push:dev`.

## Deploy to Coolify

eeSimple Bookmarks is built to self-deploy. In production a single Docker image (the repo-root `Dockerfile`)
runs the **gateway** on port **3000**: it serves the client's static build, proxies `/api/*` to the
middleware (spawned as a child process), and on boot brings the database schema up to date — it runs
the versioned migrations (`dist/db/migrate.js`) and then a reconciling `drizzle-kit push` — against
`DATABASE_URL`. The only configuration it needs is `DATABASE_URL`.

1. **Provision PostgreSQL.** In your Coolify project, add a PostgreSQL database (or use any external
   Postgres) and copy its connection string.
2. **Create the application.** New Resource → Application → connect this Git repository and branch →
   set the **Build Pack** to **Dockerfile** (Coolify uses the repo-root `Dockerfile`; no extra build
   configuration is required).
3. **Networking.** Expose container port **3000** and set the health check path to **`/healthz`**.
4. **Environment.** Add a single variable:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:5432/<database>
   ```

   (Coolify can inject the URL of a managed database for you.) The `POSTGRES_*` variables in
   `docker-compose.yml` are only for the local database and are **not** needed in Coolify.
5. **Deploy.** Coolify builds the multi-stage image and starts the gateway. The schema is applied
   automatically on first boot. Visit the app URL and check `GET /healthz` returns `{"status":"ok"}`.

> **If the schema didn't apply automatically.** The gateway applies migrations and then a
> reconciling push on boot. If a deploy logged a schema error and the app is failing against a
> stale schema, you can apply it by hand from the container terminal (Coolify → the app →
> **Terminal**). Run it from the middleware package, not the gateway working directory:
>
> ```bash
> cd /app/packages/middleware && node dist/db/migrate.js && pnpm exec drizzle-kit push --force
> ```
>
> Running these from `/app/packages/gateway` (the default directory) fails — the gateway package
> has no `drizzle-kit` dependency, no `drizzle.config.*`, and no migrations folder there.

### How it works in production

The gateway (`packages/gateway/server.js`) spawns the middleware, restarts it with exponential
backoff if it crashes, waits for its `/healthz` probe, and serves `packages/client/dist` with an
SPA fallback. Everything runs in one container.

**Smoke-test the production image locally:**

```bash
docker compose up --build      # gateway on http://localhost:3000, Postgres alongside
```

#### Deploying with the Docker Compose build pack

If you deploy this `docker-compose.yml` directly (instead of the Dockerfile build pack above),
the `db` service publishes Postgres on the host. On a shared Coolify host where another stack
already binds host port `5432` (e.g. [course-tracker](https://github.com/emilyeserven/course-tracker)),
this fails with `Bind for 0.0.0.0:5432 failed: port is already allocated`. Set a free host port
for this stack — the gateway still reaches Postgres internally at `db:5432`, so only the host-side
mapping changes:

```
POSTGRES_HOST_PORT=5433
GATEWAY_HOST_PORT=3000
```

## Releases

Versioning and `CHANGELOG.md` are automated by
