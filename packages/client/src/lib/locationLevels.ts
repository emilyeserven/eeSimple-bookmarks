/**
 * # The Locations "Levels-overlay" model
 *
 * This module is the pure, unit-tested core of the map "Levels" overlay — the little panel that
 * decides which location levels show on a map and how each renders. It has no React and no I/O;
 * `hooks/useLocationMapLevelControls.ts` wires it to state and `components/LocationMap*.tsx` render
 * the result. Read this before touching the subsystem — it is the spec the corrective PRs
 * (#794/#804/#811/#813/#814/#815) each lacked. The companion `.claude/skills/locations-map` skill
 * covers the whole subsystem (rendering, place types, geocoding); this block is just the state model.
 *
 * ## Level group
 * A `PlaceTypeLevelGroup` (`@eesimple/types`) is a named, ordered bucket of normalized `placeType`
 * keys — e.g. "Country" = `{country}`, "City" = `{city, town, …}`. `sortOrder` orders them, **lower =
 * broader** (Country before City). Each group carries a `displayMode` (pin/area), `color`, a `visible`
 * "visible by default" override, a `showOnMainMap` flag, and a `levelMode` (above/current/below). The
 * groups array is the single source of truth, persisted on the `app_settings` singleton and read/written
 * through `hooks/useLocationLevels.ts` (shared with Settings → Locations → Level Groups).
 *
 * ## Scope + anchors
 * Every map declares a {@link LevelScope}: `main` (the all-locations index map), `location` (a place's
 * own pages — carries that place's `currentPlaceType`), or `bookmark` (a bookmark's map — carries its
 * tagged locations' `placeTypes`). A non-`main` scope resolves **anchor** groups
 * ({@link resolveAnchorGroups} / {@link findAnchorGroup}): the group(s) owning the viewed/tagged place
 * type(s). Each anchor then expands up or down per **its own** `levelMode`
 * ({@link expandAnchorsByOwnMode}) — a `bookmark` can anchor on several differently-leveled groups, each
 * expanding independently. No anchor ⇒ show every group (avoids an empty map). See
 * {@link computeVisibleLevelGroupIds}.
 *
 * ## Visibility layering
 * The set a map actually shows is a three-layer composition (see {@link resolveVisibleLevelGroupIds}):
 *
 *     visibleIds = (overrideIds ?? defaultVisibleIds) ∩ populatedIds
 *
 * - `defaultVisibleIds` = {@link computeVisibleLevelGroupIds} for the scope, minus any `visible:false`
 *   group (the per-group "visible by default" override).
 * - `overrideIds` = the user's temporary per-map checkbox tweaks (null until they touch a checkbox).
 * - `populatedIds` = {@link computePopulatedLevelGroupIds}: groups with a plotted node of their own type
 *   **plus** their broader ancestors; everything else is disabled so it can never show.
 *
 * ## Three persistence tiers (the part that trips fixes)
 * State lives at three different lifetimes, and two controls sitting on the **same overlay row** persist
 * differently — read this before "fixing" an overlay control:
 * - **Server / global** — the level groups themselves (pin/area `displayMode`, `color`, `levelMode`,
 *   `visible`, `showOnMainMap`). The overlay's pin/area toggle, color glyph, and "Show" (level-mode)
 *   button write straight through to these, mutating the same rows as Settings → Locations and firing a
 *   toast — a change here is global, on every map.
 * - **uiStore / per-device** — map collapse state and `hideLocationMapAdminBorders` (the "Hide map
 *   borders" checkbox).
 * - **Session / local** — `overrideIds` (the per-map visibility checkboxes) and the anchor-less
 *   `fallbackMode`. These reset on scope/mode change and never persist.
 *
 * So on one row the **visibility checkbox** is a throwaway per-map override while the **pin/area
 * toggle** next to it is a global server write. That asymmetry is intentional; don't unify them.
 *
 * ## Two distinct prune operations (don't conflate them)
 * - **Filter-pruning** — `selectedSubtrees(tree, filterIds)` in `LocationMapSection` keeps each selected
 *   node **with its subtree**, focusing the map while preserving hierarchy.
 * - **PlaceType-flattening** — {@link filterTreeByPlaceType} (and `collectMapped` in `LocationMap`)
 *   **drops** hierarchy, because a placeType filter crosses branches (a matching node can sit anywhere).
 * Several corrective PRs conflated these; they are different operations for different jobs.
