/**
 * Runtime migrations — imperative, idempotent schema fix-ups that run on every boot, BEFORE the
 * gateway's `drizzle-kit push`.
 *
 * `push` is the source of truth for the schema: it diffs `schema.ts` against the live database and
 * applies every *additive* change (new tables, columns, constraints, indexes) on its own. What it
 * cannot do safely or non-interactively is the *destructive* / special cases — dropping a column or
 * table, `ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE`, renames, or data-preserving transforms. Those belong here: each
 * is a small step that transforms the database so push's subsequent diff stays purely additive (and
 * so push never blocks on an interactive prompt in this non-TTY deploy, and needs no `--force`).
 *
 * Every step runs on every start, so each MUST be idempotent — guard with `IF EXISTS` /
 * `IF NOT EXISTS`, check before mutating, etc. Add one by pushing to `migrations`, e.g.:
 *
 *   import { sql } from "drizzle-orm";
 *   { name: "drop legacy websites.color", run: db => db.execute(sql`ALTER TABLE "websites" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "color"`) }
 *
 * The array is intentionally empty: the historical entries had all applied on the single production
 * deployment (issue #862), so they were pruned — a fresh database gets its whole schema from
 * `drizzle-kit push`. The mechanism stays for the next destructive/prompting change.
 *
 * Run via `migrate:prod` (compiled) or `migrate:dev` (tsx); the gateway runs it on boot.
